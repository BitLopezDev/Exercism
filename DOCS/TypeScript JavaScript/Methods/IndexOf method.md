[The `indexOf` method in JavaScript returns the first index at which a given element can be found in an array, or `-1` if it is not present](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) [1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf). This method compares the search element to elements of the array using strict equality (the same algorithm used by the `===` operator) [1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf).

The syntax of the `indexOf` method is as follows: `array.indexOf(searchElement[, fromIndex])`. The parameters are as follows:

- `searchElement`: Element to locate in the array.
- `fromIndex` (optional): Zero-based index at which to start searching, converted to an integer.

Here is an example of how to use the `indexOf` method to find the index of an element in an array:

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(myArray.indexOf(3)); // 2
console.log(myArray.indexOf(6)); // -1
```



In this example, the `indexOf` method is used to find the index of the element with value `3` in the array. If the element is found, its index is returned. If the element is not found, `-1` is returned.


1. Finding all occurrences of an element in an array:

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3];
let searchElement = 3;
let indices = [];

let index = myArray.indexOf(searchElement);

while (index !== -1) {
  indices.push(index);
  index = myArray.indexOf(searchElement, index + 1);
}

console.log(indices); // [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, the `indexOf` method is used in a loop to find all occurrences of the element with value `3` in the array. The indices of the found elements are stored in the `indices` array.

2. Removing all occurrences of an element from an array:

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3];
let searchElement = 3;

for (let i = myArray.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  if (myArray[i] === searchElement) {
    myArray.splice(i, 1);
  }
}

console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

In this example, a loop is used to iterate over the elements of the array in reverse order. If an element with value `3` is found, it is removed from the array using the `splice` method.
